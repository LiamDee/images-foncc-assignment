# images-foncc-assignment
Images used for the FoNCC assignment.

I must acknowledge that the images used have been remade by myself, with inspiration taken from the lecture slides from FoNCC, available on GCU Blackboard, Specifically from "Lec 2 Cloud Models & Patterns" and "Lec 3 Cloud Architecture & Services". I am acknowledging this is to ensure later down the line I am not accused of plagirising from the lecture material by any GCU staff.

For any questions regarding this, please email me via my GCU Email account.
